# GoDurham Transit Routes 2, 2A, and 2B

GoDurham Transit [routes 2, 2A, and 2B](http://admin.gotransitnc.org/sites/default/files/godurham/aug2016/Route%202%20PDF%20August%202016.pdf) share a common alignment throughout the majority of the route, but they vary in several different aspects.

  * Route 2 is core service, running most hours.
  * Route 2 includes a deviation on Main Street nights, Sundays, and holidays.
  * Routes 2A and 2B operate daytime hours Monday through Saturday.
  * Route 2B serves additional stops in a deviation of the shared alignment path.
