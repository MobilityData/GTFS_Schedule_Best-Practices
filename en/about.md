## About This Document

### Objectives

The objectives of maintaining GTFS Best Practices is to:

* Support greater interoperability of transit data
* Improve end-user customer experience in public transportation apps
* Make it easier for software developers to deploy and scale applications, products, and services
* Facilitate the use of GTFS in various application categories (beyond its original focus on trip planning)
