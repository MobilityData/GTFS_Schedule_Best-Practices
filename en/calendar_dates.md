### calendar_dates.txt

| Field Name | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| All Fields | `calendar_dates.txt` should only contain a limited number of exceptions to the schedule. Regularly-scheduled service should be configured using `calendar.txt`. |
| | Including a `calendar.service_name` field can also increase the human readability of GTFS, although this is not adopted in the spec.|
