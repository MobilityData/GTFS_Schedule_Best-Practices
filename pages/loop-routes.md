This section covers particular cases with implications across files and fields.

<h3 id="loop-routes">Loop Routes</h3>

On loop routes, vehiclesâ€™ trips begin and end at the same location (sometimes a transit or transfer center). Vehicles usually operate continuously and allow passengers to stay onboard as the vehicle continues its loop.

      Often, a loop route may include first and last trips that do not travel the entire loop. Include these trips as well.
